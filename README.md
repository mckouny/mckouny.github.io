# [Data Collection Website Prototypel]
This is a prototype to discuss some design and implementation approaches. For the final thing, I'll obviously play around with some buttons, popups, forms, fix the links, css and stuff. Even the text is not entirely final.

## Files and Questions

hashing script.py + commands curated.json
* Are you generally happy with the algorithm? Feels pretty robust to me.
* How to include the whitelist of commands? Currently json, would it be better to include in the the main file?
* If bcrypt is not the best option, what other approach should I use? Ideally something that can be easily used in JS as well.
* I have yet to implement uppercase support (straightforward)

index.html
* it may all be a bit messy for now, still setting up my environment so no linter yet or anything

js/resume.js
* What should I be sending over to the server? Currently end up with a string(s), which I'll add to an array
* Is the random script for displaying email good enough for showing your emaiL?
* Here again, could you please recommoend some library to do the hashing?
